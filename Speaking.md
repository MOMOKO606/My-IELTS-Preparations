Answer:  
Well, we‘d like to go on a mini vacation on the weekend now and then. In fact, it probably is the best leisure activity my whole family like the most.

I can’t say exactly how often we do this. Usually we do this every three months. But sometimes we would double the time in between when we get busy.

Normally we spend 1 or 2 nights at an upmarket resort on the outskirt of our city. To be more specific, it’s our favorite Marriott hotel with natural hot spring. The fabulous part is, it has an Olympic sized heating swimming pool, so we really enjoy swimming there. I mean, we either swimming in the pool or relaxing in the spring the whole day. After that we will have a delicious buffet at the hotel. So approximately, the whole trip costs me 3000 RMB, a little bit expensive.

In terms of the feelings, first up, I think it’s quite important and necessary to have some downtime together with your family. It tends to build a stronger bond between us. Secondly, swimming has lots of pros for us, it’s incredible for my body….peaceful water clears my mind as well,(we get rid of all the pressure and bad mood after a stressful week. )We exercise our bodies and relax our brains. We definitely get the best of both worlds.

Answer:  
It’s gotta be professional swimming, not to swim like an amateur but like the professional athlete with flip turn and jump. 

Obviously, I need to keep practicing every day to become a professional swimmer And for me, the most difficult aspect is the psychological one. I’m worried about I’d bash my head when I am learning the flip turn when the depth of the pool is not deep enough, I’m worried about drowning as well. I’m gonna have to get over this scary feelings.

In fact, I’m planning on start my training right after this IELTS test.

The reasons, I believe, first up, probably because I’m a competitive person. 
I will fight tooth and nail to be the best. I’m quite into the experience of reaching to the top of my game. Secondly, it’s like setting myself a challenge, which motivates me to do the sports. It feels like an invisible instructor who keeps shouting at me, to make me go faster and get up those hills. Without the challenge I don’t think I would push myself that hard. Lastly, I’ve always wanted to be a professional athlete, sports star. It’s a dream from my childhood. But you know, in china, we can’t have the best of both worlds, which means we have to choose to either go to sports school or go to regular middle school when we are 13. And I have already experienced middle school, so it’s time to pick up the old dreams and carry on.
