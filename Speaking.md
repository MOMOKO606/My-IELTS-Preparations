********************
Answer:  
Well, we‘d like to go on a mini vacation on the weekend now and then. In fact, it probably is the best leisure activity my whole family like the most.

I can’t say exactly how often we do this. Usually we do this every three months. But sometimes we would double the time in between when we get busy.

Normally we spend 1 or 2 nights at an upmarket resort on the outskirt of our city. To be more specific, it’s our favorite Marriott hotel with natural hot spring. The fabulous part is, it has an Olympic sized heating swimming pool, so we really enjoy swimming there. I mean, we either swimming in the pool or relaxing in the spring the whole day. After that we will have a delicious buffet at the hotel. So approximately, the whole trip costs me 3000 RMB, a little bit expensive.

In terms of the feelings, first up, I think it’s quite important and necessary to have some downtime together with your family. It tends to build a stronger bond between us. Secondly, swimming has lots of pros for us, it’s incredible for my body….peaceful water clears my mind as well,(we get rid of all the pressure and bad mood after a stressful week. )We exercise our bodies and relax our brains. We definitely get the best of both worlds.

what the sport is

And explain why you would like to try this kind of sport.
********************
Answer:  
It’s gotta be professional swimming, not to swim like an amateur but like the professional athlete with flip turn and jump. 

Obviously, I need to keep practicing every day to become a professional swimmer And for me, the most difficult aspect is the psychological one. I’m worried about I’d bash my head when I am learning the flip turn when the depth of the pool is not deep enough, I’m worried about drowning as well. I’m gonna have to get over this scary feelings.

In fact, I’m planning on start my training right after this IELTS test.

The reasons, I believe, first up, probably because I’m a competitive person. 
I will fight tooth and nail to be the best. I’m quite into the experience of reaching to the top of my game. Secondly, it’s like setting myself a challenge, which motivates me to do the sports. It feels like an invisible instructor who keeps shouting at me, to make me go faster and get up those hills. Without the challenge I don’t think I would push myself that hard. Lastly, I’ve always wanted to be a professional athlete, sports star. It’s a dream from my childhood. But you know, in china, we can’t have the best of both worlds, which means we have to choose to either go to sports school or go to regular middle school when we are 13. And I have already experienced middle school, so it’s time to pick up the old dreams and carry on.

********************
Answer:  

Well, I’d like to work as an algorithm engineer in the world’s top companies in Canada for a short period of time.

The main responsibility of this job is to study the latest algorithms, to design, analyze, even to optimized algorithms. Basically, algorithms are calculations behind our smartphones or laptops, they are not something tangible, but they are all around us, the world is made up of algorithms, literally.

And I first knew this job when I was a sophomore student in college. After I watched a series of lectures produced by MIT on the internet. For the first time ever, I learned how useful it is on a day-to-day basis. Then I was totally intrigued by algorithms. And I learned the knowledge in programming and algorithms. 

In terms of the reasons, first up, it’s an old dream from my childhood, I’ve always wanted to become an engineer in the world’s top companies. The biggest attraction of the job is that you know you actually make a difference in people’s lives. For instance, … Sounds wonderful, doesn’t it. Secondly my family and I are moving to Toronto, I heard Microsoft has a brand new quarter in Toronto, and it offers excellent salary. And it has an Olympic sized heating swimming pool. I’m a swim enthusiast. So if I could get the job, I definitely get the best of both worlds. (Lastly I feel like this job curves your personality. You need to be focused, patient and perseverant. You have to be meticulous when dealing with rows and rows of data. It keeps you updating your knowledge, it helps you become a lifelong learner.)
