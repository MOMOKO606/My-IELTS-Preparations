## Picnics 野餐 (New)

<font color=red>1. **Have you ever had a picnic?**</font>  
I have never had a picnic, it is not common to have picnics in my city. Probably because of the air pollution. 

<font color=red>2. **How often do you have a picnic?**</font>  
Like I just said. Sadly I have never had one. Maybe we will have a good outdoor lifestyle in the future and lots of picnics as well.


<font color=red>3. **Where do you usually go for a picnic?**</font>  
Well I don't know. But I suppose people usually go for a picnic in a park, on the river bank or on the beach.

<font color=red>4. **Did you have picnics when you were a child?**</font> 
I wish we had a picnic when I was young, but my parents were too busy with their work.

<font color=red>5. **What’s the difference, picnic eating in your home?**</font> 
Obviously, it’s much more convenient when eating at home. But picnics are more romantic.

<font color=red>**1NEW01-1.4(2). Describe an activity you do occasionally that is a little expensive. 偶尔做的有点贵的运动 (New)**</font>   
You should say:  
what the activity is and how often you do it?  
when and where you do this activity?  
how much it costs you to do this activity And explain why you do this activity.

Well, we‘d like to go on a mini vacation on the weekend now and then. In fact, it probably is the best leisure activity my whole family like the most.

I can’t say exactly how often we do this. Usually we do this every three months. But sometimes we would double the time in between when we get busy.

Normally we spend 1 or 2 nights at an upmarket resort on the outskirt of our city. To be more specific, it’s our favorite Marriott hotel with natural hot spring. The fabulous part is, it has an Olympic sized heating swimming pool, so we really enjoy swimming there. I mean, we either swimming in the pool or relaxing in the spring the whole day. After that we will have a delicious buffet at the hotel. So approximately, the whole trip costs me 3000 RMB, a little bit expensive.

In terms of the feelings, first up, I think it’s quite important and necessary to have some downtime together with your family. It tends to build a stronger bond between us. Secondly, swimming has lots of pros for us, it’s incredible for my body….peaceful water clears my mind as well,(we get rid of all the pressure and bad mood after a stressful week. )We exercise our bodies and relax our brains. We definitely get the best of both worlds.
